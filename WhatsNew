Version 0.11
    * Changed the way null gets converted to undef when converting
      from JSON.  Instead of returning &PL_sv_undef, it now gets
      returned as a new, unitialized SV.  This keeps Data::Dumper from
      outputing undef as an alias to another undef value in the data
      structure.

Version 0.10
    * Add methods true() and false() to return objects that will get
      encoded as true and false, respectively, when converting to
      JSON.

Version 0.09
    * Fixed the bad_char_policy option -- it was being ignored

Version 0.08
    * Fixed problem encoding scalars that have been used as both
      strings and numbers (types SVt_PVN, SVt_PVIV)

Version 0.07
    * Fixed more problems with Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat objects

Version 0.06
    * Fixed problems with tests using Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat objects

Version 0.05
    * Bad utf-8 sequences now cause an error unless you pass an option
      indicating otherwise
    * Added options for how to react to bad utf8 data
    * Added option to throw an exception on error
    * Added option to pretty-print output
    * Fixed some compilation problems on Windows

Version 0.04
    * Fixed bug where empty strings got encoded incorrectly

Version 0.03
    * Fixed bug where parsing an empty array would sometimes cause an error

Version 0.02
    * Speed optimizations
