Version 0.15
    * Added from_json_file() method
    * Added to_json_file() method
    * Fixed bug where, in Perl version >= 5.8, hash keys with
      multibyte utf-8 chars were not handled correctly
    * Changed error messages to include the module name and version,
      fixed error messages that did not specify where the error
      occurred, and added line number, character offset, and character
      column to parse error messages.

Version 0.14
    * Fixed problem with escaping '\' when decoding
    * Made some optimizations
    * Now recognize more whitespace characters
      The full list of whitespace characters recognized is:
          case 0x20:   /* space */
          case 0x09:   /* tab */
          case 0x0b:   /* vertical tab */
          case 0x0c:   /* form feed */
          case 0x0d:   /* carriage return */
          case 0x00a0: /* NSBP - non-breaking space */
          case 0x200b: /* ZWSP - zero width space */
          case 0x2029: /* PS - paragraph separator */
          case 0x2060: /* WJ - word joiner */
          case 0x0a:   /* newline */
          case 0x0085: /* NEL - next line */
          case 0x2028: /* LS - line separator */


Version 0.13
    * Fixed problem where array elements may be missing when the
      "pretty" option is turned on

Version 0.12
    * Fixed assertion failure in perl 5.8.5 when finding a tied scalar
      in a hash value

Version 0.11
    * Changed the way null gets converted to undef when converting
      from JSON.  Instead of returning &PL_sv_undef, it now gets
      returned as a new, unitialized SV.  This keeps Data::Dumper from
      outputing undef as an alias to another undef value in the data
      structure.

Version 0.10
    * Add methods true() and false() to return objects that will get
      encoded as true and false, respectively, when converting to
      JSON.

Version 0.09
    * Fixed the bad_char_policy option -- it was being ignored

Version 0.08
    * Fixed problem encoding scalars that have been used as both
      strings and numbers (types SVt_PVN, SVt_PVIV)

Version 0.07
    * Fixed more problems with Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat objects

Version 0.06
    * Fixed problems with tests using Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat objects

Version 0.05
    * Bad utf-8 sequences now cause an error unless you pass an option
      indicating otherwise
    * Added options for how to react to bad utf8 data
    * Added option to throw an exception on error
    * Added option to pretty-print output
    * Fixed some compilation problems on Windows

Version 0.04
    * Fixed bug where empty strings got encoded incorrectly

Version 0.03
    * Fixed bug where parsing an empty array would sometimes cause an error

Version 0.02
    * Speed optimizations
    * Fixed a memory leak
    * Added support for spurious commas in hashes and arrays
